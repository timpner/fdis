Functional Dependency Information System

Allows visualization and manipulation of functional dependencies (FDs) in PostgreSQL databases. fdis also support the automatic normalization to the user defined normal form of the database.

Originating from a joint bachelor's project at TU Braunschweig aiming to provide students with an interactive learning tool for database theory, fdis is also suitable for directed evaluation and improvement of database schemas.
